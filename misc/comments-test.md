You can test the [comments system]({% post_url 2020-02-05-now-with-comments %}) below. This page is here so that the original post's comments don't get cluttered up with _just testing the comments asdfasf_ messages.

After you post a comment here, you'll be able to see the assocaited pull request in the [github repository](https://github.com/travisdowns/travisdowns.github.io/pulls) for this blog (a link is also provided in the confirmation message). When I accept the PR, your comment will appear on the page after a delay of less than a minute (the time it takes to rebuild the static site).
